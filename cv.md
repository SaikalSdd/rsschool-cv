### About:

---

My experience in working with JS and React is 1,5 years. I developed a ‘digital notebook’
mobile application for iOS/Android using React Native/Redux from
scratch and successfully published it into [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bakirovasdd.digital_notebook_cell). I worked on this
project on my own: starting from app design till production, and it was
a great experience! Now I work on commercial projects - products in different domains in a team using modern technologies. I love React and it is real pleasure for me to work with this library. I hope my experience and completed projects will convince you of my abilities and my motivation to work and grow in your company.
